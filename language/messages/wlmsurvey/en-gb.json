	"2013-welcome-text": "The goal of this survey is to gather statistics about people who participated in Wiki Loves Monuments, their motivations for doing so, and their opinions on the way the competition was organised. Our goal is to use this information to improve your experience with Wiki Loves Monuments, and to make the next edition of the contest even friendlier, easier, and more fun to participate in!\nWe will use your answers in this survey to create anonymised statistics, and will not be using, sharing or making public any personally identifiable data under any circumstances. For the data analysis we will this year be supported by a group of students of the Bern University of Applied Sciences, Switzerland.\nIt takes about 5 minutes to fill out this survey, and we thank you in advance for taking the time to do so. Please note that none of the questions are obligatory, and you can refrain from answering them if you wish to.\nWe thank you for your participation in the survey.\n\nYours,\nCristian, Lodewijk, Monica, Karthik, Platonides, and Romaine\nWiki Loves Monuments coordinating team, info@wikilovesmonuments.org",
